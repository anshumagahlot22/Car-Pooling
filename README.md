#  why this project and what problem does it solve >???
Carpooling System is an automated system which reduces the misery of travellers and makes
them find cars in short period of time. Carpooling is an application of finding car in which
drivers who are traveling to work alone can ask for fellow passengers through our application.
For those who use public-transport system to go to work daily can use this application to find
drivers who are traveling to the same destination in a short path. It provides with a simple
riding platform between the car owner and car user. This project enables users to access
mobility assets own by others exactly when they need. It shows a medium for available cars
to pick up them on the interest of car owner with time and capacity. This project aims at
creation of a Car-pooling System


There is an acute problem of traffic on roads these days and the increasing fuel prices add to
the misery of daily users of personal vehicles. Also, the use of vehicles causes pollution 
which has adverse effects. Carpooling is a solution but issues like security and trust come 
into the picture.
 Can this problem be solved?
 A solution to this problem is a mobile-based Carpool system. The Carpool system would
enable its user a safe and secure way to share cars. This could include both short daily 
journeys such as going to the workplace within the city and also long inter-city trips 
specially designed for students.
The current ridesharing systems like Uber and Ola have many loopholes due to the 
centralized approach to manage business operations. These are huge markets that are only 
going to get bigger with time, as more users become comfortable with the idea of getting 
cabs to their location with the help of their mobile phones. However, these centralized 
system faces problems like
• High fees due to intermediaries.
• Lack of transparency.
• Lack of safety standards

# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
